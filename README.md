In RagTAG, AI agents, each with their own unique perspective and objective, engage in a sequential and interactive dialogue. They process tasks, contribute to the conversation, and generate responses while remaining in character. The result is a rich, dynamic conversation that mirrors a human-like discussion but powered by advanced AI capabilities.
